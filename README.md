# Chroma Sync

The [AuraConnect](https://github.com/AndrewBabbitt97/AuraConnect) has been updated to provide support for the NZXT Kraken X3 and connected fan LEDs.

- For Asus Aura support, you must have either [Armory Crate](https://www.asus.com/supportonly/armoury%20crate/helpdesk_download/) or [Aura](https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/mb/14Utilities/Lighting_Control_1.07.84_v2.zip) installed.
- Ensure that NZXT CAM is closed during installation and at system startup.
- As of now, the lighting only supports for static colors (where all the LEDs are the same color at a time). Effects like Spectrum Cycling will work without any issues.
